# Wide-and-Deep-PyTorch
PyTorch implementation of Tensorflow's Wide and Deep Algorithm

This is a PyTorch implementation of Tensorflow's Wide and Deep Algorithm. Details of the algorithm can be found [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/wide_and_deep) and the very nice research paper can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.07792). A `Keras` (quick and relatively dirty) implementation of the algorithm can be found [here](https://github.com/jrzaurin/Wide-and-Deep-Keras). 

## How to use it.

Coming soon...
