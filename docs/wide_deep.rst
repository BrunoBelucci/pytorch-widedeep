Building Wide and Deep Models
=============================

Here is the documentation to build the two architectures, and the different
options available in ``pytorch-widedeep`` as one builds the model.

:class:`pytorch_widedeep.models.wide_deep.WideDeep` is the main class. It will
collect all model components and build one of the two possible architectures
with a series of optional parameters.
