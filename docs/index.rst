pytorch-widedeep
==========

*A flexible package to combine tabular data with text and images using wide and deep models*

``pytorch-widedeep`` is based on Google's Wide and Deep Algorithm [1][2].

In general terms, ``pytorch-widedeep`` is a package to use deep learning with
tabular data. In particular, is intended to facilitate the combination of text
and images with corresponding tabular data using wide and deep models. With
that in mind there are two architectures that can be implemented with just a
few lines of code.
